    The story of fifteen billion years of cosmic evolution transforming matter and life into
    consciousness, of how science and civilization grew up together, and of the forces and
    individuals who helped shape modern science; A story told with Carl Sagan’s remarkable
    ability to make scientific ideas both comprehensible and exciting, based on his acclaimed
    television series.

    Cosmos (1980) is a popular science book by astronomer and Pulitzer Prize-winning author
    <%= link_to "Carl Sagan", carl_sagan_path %>.
    Its 13 illustrated chapters, corresponding to the 13 episodes of the Cosmos TV series, which the
    book was co-developed with and intended to complement, explore the mutual development of science
    and civilization. One of Sagan's main purposes for the book and television series was to explain
    complex scientific ideas to anyone interested in learning. Sagan also believed the television was
    one of the greatest teaching tools ever invented, so he wished to capitalize on his chance to
    educate the world. Spurred in part by the popularity of the TV series, Cosmos spent 50 weeks on
    the Publishers Weekly best-sellers list and 70 weeks on the New York Times Best Seller list to
    become the best-selling science book ever published at the time. In 1981, it received the Hugo
    Award for Best Non-Fiction Book. The book's unprecedented success ushered in a dramatic increase
    in visibility for science-themed literature. The success of the book also jumpstarted Sagan's
    literary career. The sequel to Cosmos is Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space
    (1994).

    In the original edition, each chapter is heavily illustrated. The book covers a broad range of
    topics, comprising Sagan's reflections on anthropological, cosmological, biological, historical,
    and astronomical matters from antiquity to contemporary times. Sagan reiterates his position on
    extraterrestrial life—that the magnitude of the universe permits the existence of thousands of
    alien civilizations, but no credible evidence exists to demonstrate that such life has ever
    visited earth. Sagan explores 15 billion years of cosmic evolution and the development of
    science and civilization. He traces the origins of knowledge and the scientific method,
    mixing science and philosophy, and speculates about the future of science. He also discusses
    the underlying premises of science by providing biographical anecdotes about many prominent
    scientists, placing their contributions in the broader context of the development of modern
    science.
