                                    COLLECT IMMEDIATELY FIVE HUNDRED WORDS ON WHETHER THERE IS
                                    LIFE ON MARS. The astronomer dutifully replied: NOBODY KNOWS,
                                    NOBODY KNOWS, NOBODY KNOWS . . . 250 times. But despite this
                                    confession of ignorance, asserted with dogged persistence by
                                    an expert, no one paid any heed, and from that time to this,
                                    we hear authoritative pronouncements by those who think they
                                    have deduced life on Mars, and by those who think they have
                                    excluded it. Some people very much want there to be life on
                                    Mars; others very much want there to be no life on Mars.
                                    There have been excesses in both camps. These strong passions
                                    have somewhat frayed the tolerance for ambiguity that is
                                    essential to science. There seem to be many people who simply
                                    wish to be told an answer, any answer, and thereby avoid the
                                    burden of keeping two mutually exclusive possibilities in
                                    their heads at the same time. Some scientists have believed
                                    that Mars is inhabited on what has later proved to be the
                                    flimsiest evidence. Others have concluded the planet is
                                    lifeless because a preliminary search for a particular
                                    manifestation of life has been unsuccessful or ambiguous. The

                                    do better. Our ships will travel faster. There will be
                                      designated interstellar objectives, and sooner or later our
                                      spacecraft will have human crews. In the Milky Way Galaxy
                                      there must be many planets millions of years older than
                                      Earth, and some that are billions of years older. Should
                                      we not have been visited? In all the billions of years
                                      since the origin of our planet, has there not been even
                                      once a strange craft from a distant civilization
                                      surveying our world from above, and slowly settling down
                                      to the surface to be observed by iridescent dragonflies,
                                      incurious reptiles, screeching primates or wondering humans?
                                      The idea is natural enough. It has occurred to everyone who
                                      has contemplated, even casually, the question of intelligent
                                      life in the universe. But has it happened in fact?",

                             text: "The Cosmos was discovered only yesterday. For a million years
                                    it was clear to everyone that there were no other places than
                                    the Earth. Then in the last tenth of a percent of the lifetime
                                    of our species, in the instant between Aristarchus and ourselves,
                                    we reluctantly noticed that we were not the center and purpose of
                                    the Universe, but rather lived on a tiny and fragile world lost
                                    in immensity and eternity, drifting in a great cosmic ocean
                                    dotted here and there with a hundred billion galaxies and a
                                    billion trillion stars. We have bravely tested the waters and
                                    have found the ocean to our liking, resonant with our nature.
                                    Something in us recognizes the Cosmos as home. We are made of
                                    stellar ash. Our origin and evolution have been tied to distant
                                    cosmic events. The exploration of the Cosmos is a voyage of
                                    self-discovery.",
